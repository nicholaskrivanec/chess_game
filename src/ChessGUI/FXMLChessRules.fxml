While the exact origins of chess are unclear, modern rules first took form during the Middle Ages. The rules continued to be slightly modified until the early 19th century, when they reached essentially their current form. The rules also varied somewhat from place to place. Today, the standard rules are set by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs), the international governing body for chess. Slight modifications are made by some national organizations for their own purposes. There are variations of the rules for fast chess, correspondence chess, online chess, and Chess960.Chess is a two-player board game utilizing a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The goal of the game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign if they believe they will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways.Besides the basic moves of the pieces, rules also govern the equipment used, time control, conduct and ethics of players, accommodations for physically challenged players, and recording of moves using chess notation. Procedures for resolving irregularities that can occur during a game are provided as well." wrapText="true" />

No matter what the actual colors of the board, the lighter-colored squares are called &quot;light&quot; or &quot;white&quot;, and the darker-colored squares are called &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;black&quot;. Sixteen &quot;white&quot; and sixteen &quot;black&quot; pieces are placed on the board at the beginning of the game. The board is placed so that a white square is in each player's near-right corner. Horizontal rows are called ranks and vertical rows are called files. Each player controls sixteen At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged ... for each side one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. The pieces are placed, one on a square, as follows:&#10;&#10;-The rooks are placed on the outside corners, right and left edge.&#10;&#10;-The knights are placed immediately inside of the rooks.&#10;&#10;-The bishops are placed immediately inside of the knights.&#10;&#10;-The queen is placed on the central square of the same color of that of the player: white queen on the white square and black queen on the black square.&#10;&#10;-The king takes the vacant spot next to the queen.&#10;&#10;-The pawns are placed one square in front of all of the other pieces.&#10;&#10;Popular mnemonics used to remember the setup are &quot;queen on her own color&quot; and &quot;white on right&quot;. The latter refers to setting up the board so that the square closest to each player's right is white (Schiller 2003:16–17)." wrapText="true" />

In addition, if the game is being played under a time control players who exceed their time limit lose the game.The official chess rules do not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, in the case of non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.&#10;&#10;" wrapText="true" />

A piece moves to a vacant square except when capturing an opponent's piece.Except for any move of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is captured (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces it on its square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game.&#10;&#10; The king can be put in check but cannot be captured.The king moves exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A special move with the king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).A rook moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal or vertical direction. It also is moved when castling.&#10;&#10;A bishop moves any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.&#10;&#10;The queen moves any number of vacant squares in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.&#10;&#10;A knight moves to the nearest square not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares vertically—i.e. in an &quot;L&quot; pattern.) The knight is not blocked by other pieces: it jumps to the new location.&#10;&#10;Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move backwards.Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. A pawn can capture an enemy piece on either of the two squares diagonally in front of the pawn (but cannot move to those squares if they are vacant).The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion (Schiller 2003:17–19)." wrapText="true" />

This capture is only legal on the opponent's next move immediately following the first pawn's advance. The diagrams on the right demonstrate an instance of this: if the white pawn moves from a2 to a4, the black pawn on b4 can capture it en passant, moving from b4 to a3 while the white pawn on a4 is removed from the board.&#10;&#10;Pawn promotion&#10;    If a player advances a pawn to its eighth rank, the pawn is then promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color at the choice of the player (a queen is usually chosen). The choice is not limited to previously captured pieces. Hence it is theoretically possible for a player to have up to nine queens or up to ten rooks, bishops, or knights if all of their pawns are promoted. If the desired piece is not available, the player should call the arbiter to provide the piece (Schiller 2003:17–19).[4]" wrapText="true" />

The possible ways to get out of check:&#10; &#10;-Move the king to a square where it is not in check.&#10;&#10;-Capture the checking piece (possibly with the king). &#10;&#10;-Block the check by placing a piece between the king and the opponent's threatening piece (Just 2014), (Polgar &amp; Truong 2005:32,103), (Burgess 2009:550).&#10;&#10;If it is not possible to get out of check, the king is checkmated and the game is over.
